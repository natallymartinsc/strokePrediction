# Stroke Prediction Model

## Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model to identify individuals at risk of stroke (AVC) using the Stroke Prediction Dataset. By analyzing patients' health conditions and personal attributes, the model seeks to predict the likelihood of a stroke, allowing for early intervention and preventive measures.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Stroke Prediction Dataset**, which contains data on various health conditions of patients. It includes features such as age, hypertension, heart disease, smoking status, and more, which are relevant to predicting the risk of stroke.

## Project Structure

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature engineering, and normalization of data.
- **Model Training**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets. Several Machine Learning models are trained to find the best-performing one.
- **Evaluation**: Models are evaluated using various metrics to assess their accuracy and reliability in predicting stroke risk.
